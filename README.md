# This is my first project with `NestJs`

In this project, I learned to create a `RestFullApi` using the `NestJs` framework.
There are many things I can learn from this project, including:

- Creating RestFull API
- Learning Authentication with `Passport`
- Creating custom `Guard` and `Decorator`
- How to create `GitHub Action` for automatic testing
- Deploying `Swagger UI` to `GitHub Pages` with `GitHub Action`

> You can visit the `Swagger Ui` for this RestFull API projects in [GitHub Pages](https://zamzami16.github.io/system-toko/#/)
